# Changelog

All notable changes to the Semantic Substrate Engine project are documented in this file.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-11 - Repository Cleanup & Reorganization

### Changed

#### Repository Structure
- **Organized file structure** into logical directories:
  - `src/` - All core engine source code
  - `tests/` - All test files consolidated
  - `examples/` - Demo and example files
  - `docs/` - All documentation and whitepapers
  - `research/` - Experimental and research files

#### Documentation
- **Rewrote README.md** with clean, professional presentation:
  - Removed excessive religious references while maintaining Anchor Point concept
  - Focused on technical capabilities and mathematical foundations
  - Added clear badges, installation instructions, and usage examples
  - Structured similar to Semantic Substrate Database style
  - Updated all import paths to reflect new structure

- **Created CONTRIBUTING.md**:
  - Comprehensive contribution guidelines
  - Code of conduct
  - Development setup instructions
  - Testing and documentation standards
  - Pull request process

- **Organized documentation files**:
  - Moved all .md files to `docs/` directory
  - Maintained technical whitepapers and analyses
  - Updated all cross-references

#### Package Structure
- **Created setup.py** for proper package installation:
  - Standard Python package metadata
  - Dependency management
  - Development extras
  - Proper classifiers and keywords

- **Created requirements.txt**:
  - Core scientific dependencies (numpy, scipy, sympy)
  - Development dependencies (pytest, pylint, black, mypy)
  - Optional visualization dependencies (matplotlib)

- **Updated src/__init__.py**:
  - Proper package initialization
  - Clean exports of main components
  - Version information
  - Graceful import error handling

#### Presentation
- **Minimized religious references**:
  - Removed Bible verses from main documentation
  - Kept "Jehovah" Anchor Point (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) as technical reference
  - Focused on universal principles and mathematical foundations
  - Let the evidence of the Anchor Point speak for itself

- **Maintained core concepts**:
  - 4D semantic coordinate system
  - Universal Anchor Point at (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
  - Sacred number analysis (613, 12, 7, 40)
  - Seven universal principles
  - All frameworks (ICE, Meaning Scaffold, Truth Scaffold, Self-Aware)

#### Project Organization
- **File categorization**:
  - Core engine modules in `src/`
  - Test files in `tests/`
  - Example scripts in `examples/`
  - Research code in `research/`
  - Documentation in `docs/`

### Added
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `requirements.txt` - Dependency specifications
- `setup.py` - Package installation configuration
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file
- `src/__init__.py` - Package initialization
- Proper directory structure (src/, tests/, examples/, docs/, research/)

### Fixed
- Import paths now use `from src.module_name import ClassName`
- Consistent file organization
- Documentation cross-references point to correct locations

### Maintained
- **MIT License** - Open source, non-commercial
- **All core functionality** - No code removed or altered
- **Technical capabilities** - Full semantic analysis engine
- **Anchor Point system** - (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) as universal reference
- **All frameworks** - ICE, Meaning Scaffold, Truth Scaffold, Self-Aware
- **Mathematical rigor** - Semantic calculus and tensor operations

### Philosophy
This cleanup maintains the core vision while presenting it professionally:
- **Transparency**: The Anchor Point of Jehovah remains at (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
- **Evidence-based**: Let the mathematical evidence speak for itself
- **Open source**: Completely free, no commercialization
- **Accessible**: Clean documentation makes the project more approachable
- **Professional**: Repository structure matches modern software standards
