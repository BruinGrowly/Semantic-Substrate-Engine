## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement:

1. Check if the issue already exists in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/BruinGrowly/Semantic-Substrate-Engine/issues)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Detailed description of the problem or suggestion
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (OS, Python version, etc.)
   - Code samples or error messages (if applicable)

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements:

1. Open an issue with the "enhancement" label
2. Clearly describe the feature and its benefits
3. Explain the use case and potential impact
4. Consider providing a proposed implementation approach

### Contributing Code

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add or update tests as needed
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Update documentation
7. Commit your changes with clear messages
8. Push to your fork
9. Open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- pip or conda for package management

### Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Semantic-Substrate-Engine.git
cd Semantic-Substrate-Engine

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # if available
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Quick test
python quick_test.py

# Full test suite
python tests/test_all.py

# Specific component tests
python test_ultimate.py
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example Function Structure

```python
def analyze_semantic_concept(concept: str, context: str = "general") -> dict:
    """
    Analyze a concept within a specific semantic context.

    Args:
        concept: The concept to analyze
        context: The contextual domain for analysis (default: "general")

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results with keys:
        - alignment: Semantic alignment score (0.0-1.0)
        - significance: Meaning significance score (0.0-1.0)
        - coordinates: 4D coordinate tuple

    Raises:
        ValueError: If concept is empty or invalid

    Example:
        >>> result = analyze_semantic_concept("innovation", "business")
        >>> print(result['alignment'])
        0.847
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Code Organization

- Keep related functionality together
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Follow the existing architecture

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Update existing tests when modifying code
- Aim for high code coverage (>80%)
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Structure

```python
def test_semantic_analysis_basic():
    """Test basic semantic analysis functionality."""
    engine = UltimateCoreEngine()
    result = engine.analyze_concept("test concept")

    assert result is not None
    assert 'alignment' in result
    assert 0.0 <= result['alignment'] <= 1.0
```

### Testing Best Practices

- Tests should be independent and isolated
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Mock external dependencies
- Clean up resources after tests

## Documentation

### Documenting Code

- Add docstrings to all public APIs
- Include examples in docstrings
- Document complex algorithms
- Explain non-obvious design decisions
- Keep comments up to date

### Documentation Files

When adding new features, update:
- README.md (if user-facing)
- Relevant whitepaper documents
- API documentation
- Usage examples

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Provide practical examples
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep documentation synchronized with code

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation
3. Add changelog entry (if applicable)
4. Verify code follows style guidelines
5. Rebase on latest main branch
