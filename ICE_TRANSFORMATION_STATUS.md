2. **Authoritative Command** (POWER-dominant)
   - Tone: confident, clear, decisive
   - Approach: Direct, establish boundaries

3. **Instructive Guidance** (WISDOM-dominant)
   - Tone: thoughtful, explanatory, patient
   - Approach: Ask questions, facilitate insight

4. **Corrective Judgment** (JUSTICE-dominant)
   - Tone: firm, fair, principled
   - Approach: Address issues, restore fairness

5. **Balanced Response** (All axes equal)
   - Tone: balanced, comprehensive, adaptive
   - Approach: Holistic assessment, integration

### 8 Context Domains

Each with specific stability and complexity settings:

| Domain | Stability | Complexity | Anchor Pull |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Spiritual | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.30 |
| Ministry | 0.95 | 0.9 | 0.29 |
| Ethical | 0.9 | 0.8 | 0.27 |
| Relational | 0.8 | 0.7 | 0.24 |
