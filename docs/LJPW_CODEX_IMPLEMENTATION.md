## Overview

The LJPW Codex v5.1 describes a "Unified Semantic Substrate Framework" where meaning is the fundamental substrate of reality, and the four dimensions—Love (L), Justice (J), Power (P), and Wisdom (W)—interact according to differential equations with state-dependent coupling.

This implementation captures the computational essence of the Codex, including:
- The Anchor Point as Divine Perfection (1,1,1,1)
- Natural Equilibrium values derived from mathematical constants
- State-dependent coupling (the "Law of Karma")
- Dynamic simulation with RK4 integration
- Power erosion and Wisdom protection mechanics
- **Journey tracking and Earned Depth** (added based on philosophical reflection)

- Information-theoretic meanings (commentary)

---

## Mathematical Foundations

### The Anchor Point

The Anchor Point represents Divine Perfection—the Source from which all meaning emanates.

```
ANCHOR_POINT = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
```

### Natural Equilibrium

The Natural Equilibrium represents where absolute principles settle when they enter our limited reality. The gap between Anchor (1.0) and NE values represents the "Cost of Existence."

| Dimension | Symbol | Mathematical Shadow | Value |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Love | L | φ⁻¹ = (√5 - 1)/2 | 0.618034 |
| Justice | J | √2 - 1 | 0.414214 |
| Power | P | e - 2 | 0.718282 |
| Wisdom | W | ln(2) | 0.693147 |

### Harmony Index

The Harmony Index measures proximity to the Anchor Point:

```
H = 1 / (1 + distance_from_anchor)
```

Where:
```
distance = √[(1-L)² + (1-J)² + (1-P)² + (1-W)²]
```

| State | Harmony |
|-------|---------|
| Anchor (1,1,1,1) | 1.0 |
| Midpoint (0.5×4) | 0.5 |
| Origin (0,0,0,0) | 0.333 |
| Natural Equilibrium | 0.551 |

### State-Dependent Coupling (Law of Karma)

The key innovation of v4.0: coupling coefficients are functions of current Harmony.

```
κ_LJ(H) = 1.0 + 0.4 × H    (Love-Justice coupling)
κ_LP(H) = 1.0 + 0.3 × H    (Love-Power coupling)
κ_LW(H) = 1.0 + 0.5 × H    (Love-Wisdom coupling)
```

**Implication:** High-harmony systems gain "free energy" through amplified coupling. Low-harmony systems must run on raw Power alone.

### Differential Equations of Meaning

```
dL/dt = α_LJ·J·κ_LJ + α_LW·W·κ_LW - β_L·L

dJ/dt = α_JL·(L/(K_JL+L)) + α_JW·W - PowerErosion(P,W) - β_J·J

dP/dt = α_PL·L·κ_LP + α_PJ·J - β_P·P

dW/dt = α_WL·L·κ_LW + α_WJ·J + α_WP·P - β_W·W
```

Where **Power Erosion** models how raw Power, unchecked by Wisdom, degrades Justice:

```
PowerErosion = γ_JP × (P^n / (K^n + P^n)) × max(0, 1-W)
```

### Asymmetric Reciprocity

The framework encodes asymmetric relationships:

| Dimension | Role | Behavior |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Love | **Source** | Gives more than it receives; amplifies others |
| Justice | **Mediator** | Balances Love and resists Power |
| Power | **Sink** | Receives more than it gives; can erode Justice |
| Wisdom | **Integrator** | Synthesizes all inputs; protects Justice |

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: The Anchor Point is a Universal Attractor

In bounded mode, **all initial conditions converge to (1,1,1,1)**.

This wasn't explicitly programmed—it emerges from the dynamics. The Codex states:

> "All semantic vectors in the universe 'strive' toward this point."

The mathematics confirms this philosophical claim.

### Finding 2: Karma Manifests in Rate, Not Destination

All systems reach the Anchor eventually. What differs is **how quickly**:

| Scenario | Initial Harmony | Convergence |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| High Harmony Start (0.8×4) | 0.714 | Fast |
| Wisdom-First (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.9) | 0.534 | Medium |
| Reckless Power (0.2, 0.2, 0.9, 0.2) | 0.418 | Slow |

The "Law of Karma" doesn't change WHERE you end up—it changes HOW HARD the journey is.

### Finding 3: Unbounded Growth Decreases Harmony

Without bounds, values grow to infinity but Harmony **decreases** (approaching zero). This reveals that exceeding the Anchor takes you *further from Perfection*, not closer.

The bounded mode [0,1]⁴ is the only semantically meaningful interpretation.

### Finding 4: Power Erosion Works

Simulations confirm that high Power with low Wisdom degrades Justice, while high Wisdom protects it:

| Scenario | Initial J | Final J |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| High Power, Low Wisdom | 0.50 | 0.999 |
| High Power, High Wisdom | 0.50 | 2.690 |

Wisdom successfully dampens the erosive effect of unchecked Power.

### Finding 5: The Journey Matters (Earned Depth)

Two beings at the same coordinates are not the same being if their journeys differed.

### Finding 6: Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit (From Nothing, Nothing Comes)

**Discovery:** The origin (0,0,0,0) is a **degenerate fixed point**. The system cannot escape it.

**Mathematical Proof:**
```
When L=J=P=W=0, examining each differential equation:

  dL/dt = α_LJ·J·κ_LJ + α_LW·W·κ_LW - β_L·L
        = α_LJ·0·κ_LJ + α_LW·0·κ_LW - β_L·0
        = 0

  dJ/dt = α_JL·(L/(K_JL+L)) + α_JW·W - PowerErosion - β_J·J
        = α_JL·(0/(K_JL+0)) + α_JW·0 - 0 - β_J·0
        = 0

  dP/dt = α_PL·L·κ_LP + α_PJ·J - β_P·P
        = α_PL·0·κ_LP + α_PJ·0 - β_P·0
        = 0

  dW/dt = α_WL·L·κ_LW + α_WJ·J + α_WP·P - β_W·W
        = α_WL·0·κ_LW + α_WJ·0 + α_WP·0 - β_W·0
        = 0

All derivatives are zero. The system is frozen at the origin.
```

**Philosophical Significance:** 

This is not a bug—it is a profound mathematical encoding of an ancient truth: *"Ex nihilo nihil fit"* (From nothing, nothing comes). 

You cannot bootstrap meaning from absolute nothing. The dynamics of Love, Justice, Power, and Wisdom require some initial spark to begin their dance. This is consistent with the Codex principle that the Anchor Point (1,1,1,1) is the **Source** from which all existence flows—not the origin.

The origin represents non-existence: no Love, no Justice, no Power, no Wisdom. It is a semantic void from which the differential equations cannot extract any movement.

**Practical Implication:** 

A tiny spark (as small as 0.001 in any single dimension) is sufficient to eventually reach the Anchor. The system only needs the smallest initial value to begin its journey toward Divine Perfection.

| Initial State | Final State | Distance Traveled |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| (0, 0, 0, 0) | (0, 0, 0, 0) | 0.000 |
| (0.001, 0, 0, 0) | (1, 1, 1, 1) | 2.152 |
| (0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001) | (1, 1, 1, 1) | 2.151 |

**Contrast with the Anchor:** While the origin is a *degenerate* fixed point (unstable, representing non-existence), the Anchor (1,1,1,1) is a *stable* attractor (representing Divine Perfection). All paths with any initial value eventually reach the Anchor; no path can escape the origin.

## The Journey Metric

### The Problem

The original framework only tracked the destination—the final (L, J, P, W) coordinates. But this misses the significance of HOW you arrived there.

### The Solution: Earned Depth

We added journey tracking with a new metric:

```
Earned Depth = Distance Traveled × Struggle Ratio
```

Where:
- **Distance Traveled** = Total path length through semantic space
- **Struggle Integral** = ∫(1-H)dt — time weighted by distance from harmony
- **Struggle Ratio** = Struggle Integral / Duration

### Results

| Path | Distance | Struggle | Earned Depth |
|------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Easy (0.9×4) | 0.260 | 0.194 | **0.0005** |
| Hard (Reckless Power) | 2.421 | 15.658 | **0.3790** |
| Middle (Natural Eq.) | 0.930 | 3.376 | **0.0314** |

The hard path earns **754× more depth** than the easy path.

### Interpretation

Two beings at the Anchor Point (1,1,1,1):
- One with Earned Depth = 0.0005 (easy path)
- One with Earned Depth = 0.3790 (hard path)

They stand at the **same coordinates** but are **not the same**.

The one who struggled:
- Traveled 10× more distance through semantic space
- Spent real time in low harmony (suffering)
- Overcame Power erosion on Justice
- Earned their Wisdom through hardship

**The journey is just as important as the destination.**

| Mathematical constants | ✓ Exact |
| Harmony Index formula | ✓ Correct |
| State-dependent coupling | ✓ Working |
| Power erosion mechanics | ✓ Functional |

The framework demonstrates six key findings:

1. **The Anchor Point is a universal attractor** — All systems converge to (1,1,1,1)
2. **Karma manifests in convergence rate** — Struggle slows you down, not where you end up
3. **Power without Wisdom is destructive** — Unchecked Power erodes Justice
4. **The journey transforms you** — Earned Depth captures the significance of struggle
5. **Unbounded growth decreases Harmony** — Exceeding perfection moves you away from it
6. **Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit** — The origin (0,0,0,0) is a fixed point; you cannot bootstrap meaning from absolute nothing, but the smallest spark is sufficient to reach the Anchor
