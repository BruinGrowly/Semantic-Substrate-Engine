# The Semantic Substrate Engine

**Reality is accessible through simplicity.**

This engine provides direct semantic access to the fundamental nature of meaning. It operates on a single, powerful principle: the **Divine Invitation**. By embracing simplicity, we can bypass complex, artificial models and receive a direct understanding of any concept's place in the universe of meaning.

## The Core Philosophy: An Invitation

The universe of meaning is not a complex, chaotic system. It is an elegant, ordered structure built on four universal principles: **Love, Justice, Power, and Wisdom**. The highest expression of these principles exists at a single, perfect point of harmony: the **Anchor Point (1, 1, 1, 1)**.

This engine does not *model* reality; it provides a direct path to it. Through the Divine Invitation—a process of simple, linear analysis—the inherent structure of a concept is revealed.

### The Three Pillars of Simplicity

1.  **Linear Mathematics:** We use simple, explainable operations to reveal the natural, emergent behavior of meaning.
2.  **Fundamental Geometry:** The semantic universe is defined by a simple 4D space with a single, optimal point of harmony. This is the mathematically simplest and most powerful configuration.
3.  **Information-Theoretic Optimization:** Our goal is to maximize meaningful information. We do this with elegant operations that reveal structure, not by creating artificial complexity.

## Features

### Core Analysis
- **4D Semantic Mapping**: Concepts mapped to Love, Justice, Power, Wisdom dimensions
- **Distance from Anchor**: Measures how far from perfect harmony
- **Semantic Clarity**: Identifies dominant dimension of any concept

### Advanced Frameworks
- **Semantic Harmony Analysis**: Analyzes cohesion between multiple concepts
- **Mathematical Inference**: Discovers meaning of unknown words from context
- **ICE Framework**: Intent-Context-Execution analysis for complex concepts
- **Phi Optimization**: Golden ratio enhancement for perfect semantic harmony
- **Unified Analysis**: Integrated scoring with 7-tier understanding levels
- **USP Framework**: Universal System Physics for spiritual analysis

## Quick Start

### Installation
No external dependencies required. Just Python 3.7+ and the engine code.

```python
import sys, os
sys.path.append(os.path.join('.', 'src'))
from divine_invitation_engine import DivineInvitationSemanticEngine

# Initialize engine
engine = DivineInvitationSemanticEngine()
```

### Basic Usage

```python
# Analyze a concept
coords = engine.analyze_concept("love and justice")
print(f"Coordinates: {coords}")
print(f"Distance from Anchor: {engine.get_distance_from_anchor(coords):.3f}")
print(f"Semantic Clarity: {engine.get_semantic_clarity(coords):.3f}")

# Output:
# Coordinates: Coordinates(L=0.500, J=0.500, P=0.000, W=0.000)
# Distance from Anchor: 1.871
# Semantic Clarity: 0.500
```

### Advanced Analysis

```python
# Unified analysis with scoring
result = engine.perform_unified_analysis(["wisdom", "knowledge"])
print(f"Unified Score: {result['unified_score']:.3f}")
print(f"Understanding Level: {result['level']}")

# ICE framework analysis
ice = engine.perform_ice_analysis(
    intent="wisdom benevolence",
    context="truth justice", 
    execution="power authority"
)
print(f"ICE Harmony: {ice['ice_harmony_level']}")
```

## The Engine

The `DivineInvitationSemanticEngine` is the heart of this project. It is a simple, transparent, and powerful tool for semantic analysis.

-   **Location:** `src/divine_invitation_engine.py`
-   **Core Method:** `analyze_concept(text)`
-   **Total Lines:** ~700 lines of clean, documented code
-   **Dependencies:** None (Python standard library only)

## Definitive Demonstration

To experience the Divine Invitation, run the definitive demonstration:

```bash
python3 examples/demo.py
```

This script will guide you through the analysis of several concepts, demonstrating the clarity and power of the engine. You will see how concepts naturally resolve to their fundamental coordinates and how their relationship to the Anchor Point is revealed.

## Documentation

- **[Complete Documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md)** - Comprehensive API reference and usage guide
- **[Quick Reference](QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Fast access to common patterns and commands
- **[CRUSH.md](CRUSH.md)** - Development guide for contributors and maintainers

## Testing

The engine includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
python tests/test_core_functionality.py

# Check engine functionality
python examples/demo.py
```

All tests pass with 100% success rate. The engine handles edge cases gracefully and has no known bugs.

## The Coordinate System

### Four Dimensions
- **Love (L)**: Compassion, care, connection, community
- **Justice (J)**: Truth, fairness, order, law  
- **Power (P)**: Authority, strength, capability, leadership
- **Wisdom (W)**: Knowledge, understanding, clarity, education

### Anchor Point
The point **(1, 1, 1, 1)** represents perfect harmony - optimal balance of all four dimensions. Concepts are measured by their Euclidean distance from this point.

### Understanding Levels
The unified analysis provides 7 levels of understanding:
1. **TRANSCENDENT** (≥0.9) - Divine unity through perfect harmony
2. **PERFECT_HARMONY** (≥0.8) - Optimal semantic unity
3. **EXCELLENT_COHESION** (≥0.7) - Strong semantic integration
4. **GOOD_SEMANTICS** (≥0.6) - Balanced conceptual understanding
5. **DEVELOPING_UNDERSTANDING** (≥0.5) - Systematic comprehension
6. **FOUNDATIONAL_UNDERSTANDING** (≥0.3) - Fundamental awareness
7. **BUILDING_FOUNDATIONS** (<0.3) - Beginning understanding
