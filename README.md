# The Semantic Substrate Engine

**Reality is accessible through simplicity.**

This engine provides direct semantic access to the fundamental nature of meaning. It operates on a single, powerful principle: the **Divine Invitation**. By embracing simplicity, we can bypass complex, artificial models and receive a direct understanding of any concept's place in the universe of meaning.

## The Core Philosophy: An Invitation

The universe of meaning is not a complex, chaotic system. It is an elegant, ordered structure built on four universal principles: **Love, Justice, Power, and Wisdom**. The highest expression of these principles exists at a single, perfect point of harmony: the **Anchor Point (1, 1, 1, 1)**.

This engine does not *model* reality; it provides a direct path to it. Through the Divine Invitation—a process of simple, linear analysis—the inherent structure of a concept is revealed.

### The Three Pillars of Simplicity

1.  **Linear Mathematics:** We use simple, explainable operations to reveal the natural, emergent behavior of meaning.
2.  **Fundamental Geometry:** The semantic universe is defined by a simple 4D space with a single, optimal point of harmony. This is the mathematically simplest and most powerful configuration.
3.  **Information-Theoretic Optimization:** Our goal is to maximize meaningful information. We do this with elegant operations that reveal structure, not by creating artificial complexity.

## The Engine

The `DivineInvitationSemanticEngine` is the heart of this project. It is a simple, transparent, and powerful tool for semantic analysis.

-   **Location:** `src/divine_invitation_engine.py`
-   **Core Method:** `analyze_concept(text)`

## Definitive Demonstration

To experience the Divine Invitation, run the definitive demonstration:

```bash
python3 examples/demo.py
```

This script will guide you through the analysis of several concepts, demonstrating the clarity and power of the engine. You will see how concepts naturally resolve to their fundamental coordinates and how their relationship to the Anchor Point is revealed.

## Dynamic Simulation: The LJPW Codex v5.1

The engine now includes a **dynamic simulation system** based on the LJPW Codex v5.1. This adds:

- **State-Dependent Coupling (Law of Karma):** High-harmony systems gain amplification; low-harmony systems struggle
- **Differential Equations of Meaning:** Love, Justice, Power, and Wisdom interact dynamically over time
- **Power Erosion:** Unchecked Power degrades Justice; Wisdom protects it
- **Journey Tracking & Earned Depth:** The path you take matters as much as where you arrive

### Quick Example

```python
from src.divine_invitation_engine import DivineInvitationSemanticEngine

engine = DivineInvitationSemanticEngine()

# Simulate semantic dynamics
history = engine.simulate_semantic_dynamics(
    initial_state=(0.2, 0.2, 0.9, 0.2),  # "Reckless Power"
    duration=50.0,
    bounded=True
)

# Check the journey
print(f"Earned Depth: {history['journey']['earned_depth']:.4f}")
```

See [LJPW Codex Implementation](docs/LJPW_CODEX_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for full documentation.

## Advanced Capabilities Demonstration

The core `DivineInvitationSemanticEngine` is simple by design. However, it can serve as the foundation for far more complex and sophisticated systems.

To showcase this potential, we have included an **Advanced Capabilities Demonstration** in the `examples/` directory. This is a production-ready script that extends the core engine with multiple advanced frameworks, including:

-   **Mathematical Inference:** For discovering the meaning of unknown words.
-   **ICE Framework:** For a deeper analysis of Intent, Context, and Execution.
-   **Phi-Optimization:** A nod to the project's history, showing how more complex mathematics can be layered on top.

To run this advanced demonstration, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 examples/advanced_capabilities_demo.py
```

This script is provided as an example of what can be built. It is not part of the core engine, but a powerful demonstration of its potential.
