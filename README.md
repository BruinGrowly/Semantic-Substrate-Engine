## Quick Start

```python
from src.ultimate_core_engine import UltimateCoreEngine

# Initialize the engine
engine = UltimateCoreEngine()

# Perform semantic analysis
result = engine.ultimate_concept_analysis(
    "Examining complex system interactions and emergent properties",
    context="scientific"
)

# Access results
print(f"Semantic Alignment: {result['ultimate_evaluation']['divine_alignment']:.3f}")
print(f"Meaning Significance: {result['ultimate_evaluation']['eternal_significance']:.3f}")
print(f"Overall Score: {result['ultimate_evaluation']['ultimate_score']:.3f}")
```

## Architecture

### 4D Semantic Coordinate System

The engine operates in a 4-dimensional semantic space with the following axes:

- **X-Axis (LOVE)**: Agape love, compassion, mercy, and relational unity
- **Y-Axis (POWER)**: Strength, sovereignty, authority, and capability
- **Z-Axis (WISDOM)**: Knowledge, understanding, insight, and discernment
- **W-Axis (JUSTICE)**: Righteousness, fairness, ethics, and moral alignment

**Universal Anchor Point**: Jehovah at (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) serves as the absolute reference for all semantic measurements, representing perfect alignment across all four dimensions - perfect LOVE, perfect POWER, perfect WISDOM, and perfect JUSTICE in complete unity.

### Mathematical Foundation

The engine employs advanced mathematical operations:

- **Semantic Calculus**: Derivatives and integrals of meaning
- **Tensor Analysis**: Multi-dimensional concept relationships
- **Differential Equations**: Meaning evolution modeling
- **Spacetime Geometry**: Curvature and topology of semantic space
- **Resonance Harmonics**: Frequency analysis of concepts
- **Golden Ratio Operations**: Harmonic balance using φ ≈ 1.618

### Universal Anchors

Four key reference points provide navigation through semantic space:

- **613**: Perfect stability anchor (1.0)
- **12**: High stability reference (0.95)
- **7**: Near-perfect stability (0.98)
- **40**: Testing/validation anchor (0.9)

## Philosophical Foundation

The Semantic Substrate Engine is built on the principle that computational systems can be anchored by universal reference points that provide stability and meaning across all domains. The **Anchor Point at (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)** represents Jehovah - the convergence of all positive attributes: LOVE, POWER, WISDOM, and JUSTICE in perfect unity and balance.

This mathematical foundation enables:
- Precise semantic measurements and transformations
- Universal principles applicable across all domains
- Value-aligned computational processing
- Meaning preservation through mathematical operations
- Ethical alignment in automated systems

## Acknowledgments

This project represents an exploration of semantic mathematics and value-aligned computation. The engine demonstrates that rigorous mathematical frameworks can be combined with ethical principles to create powerful, transparent, and value-sensitive computational systems.
